# Buddy Scanner

I created this as an open source alternative to options on the Play Store filled with ads
This will work with Barcode Buddy after making the change listed here:
https://github.com/Forceu/barcodebuddy/issues/22#issuecomment-602178931

# Install

Just allow unknown sources and install the apk from the latest release.  Top right of app has settings where you can set your Barcode Buddy URL.  Just need the domain, not index.php with it.

# Donate

I'm just doing this for fun and prolly won't do much more with this as it just works for its purpose.  Depending on if I continue to use Grocy or not will determine if I expand this app.
